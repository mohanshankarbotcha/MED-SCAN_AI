## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML** – Structure  
- **CSS** – Clean medical UI design  
- **JavaScript** – File handling & analysis logic  

---

## 🤖 AI Working Explanation

- On **Emergent platform**, the app uses a hosted AI agent for real analysis.
- On **local VS Code**, browser limitations prevent real AI execution.
- Therefore, local execution uses **mock / rule-based AI logic** to simulate results.

This demonstrates:
- AI workflow understanding
- Frontend + AI integration design
- Real-world deployment constraints
